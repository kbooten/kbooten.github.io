With Katy Ilonka Gero, I edit [*Ensemble Park*](https://www.ensemblepark.com/)*: A Journal of Human+Computer Writing*.  We intend to document but also respond critically to  the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the ways that contemporary "AI" are changing what it means to write. *Ensemble Park* emphasizes risky and unexpected entanglements between human and machine intelligences, including LLMs as well as other---older or simply different---algorithmic systems for the production and manipulation of natural language. It is both a literary journal and a journal of rogue human-computer interaction research.

Porting personal website from expensive hosting site.

A simple site (index page + <5 others), rarely updated, so I'm just using pandoc locally to convert `.md` to `.html`.


A bash script automatically converts some local `.md` files with pandoc, and links to the stylesheet.

The html version of `map.md` (a navigation bar) is added to the top of each page.

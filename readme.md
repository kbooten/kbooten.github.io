A simple site (index page + <5 others) and exercise in minimalism. I'm just using pandoc locally to convert `.md` to `.html` files. A bash script automatically converts local `.md` files, injects links to the stylesheet, converts `map.md` (a navigation bar) to html, and adds this html to the top of each page.
